# Java Streams Assignment Project

This project demonstrates various Java Streams operations through assignment-style problems and corresponding unit tests.


## Solve the assignments
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Implement the required methods in `Assignment1.java`,  `L0Assignment.java`, and `L2Assignment.java` as per the comments and instructions provided in the files.
4. Run the unit tests in `Assignment1Test.java`, `L0AssignmentTest.java`, and `L2AssignmentTest.java` to verify your implementations.
5. Use Maven to manage dependencies and build the project. You can run `mvn clean install` to compile the code and run tests.
6. Refer to the `pom.xml` file for any additional dependencies you may need.

Feel free to modify and extend the assignments as needed for your learning purposes.


Happy coding!
